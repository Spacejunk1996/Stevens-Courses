# Link State Routing

To create a virtual network of routers that send routing data to one another.

## Usage

1.npm install 
2.tsc
3.npm start

## Entry point

./app.js

## Input file

./infile.dat (split by one or more tab or space characters)

# PS
If you shut down a router, to print the routing table correctly, you must
send two more LSP, because the router's neigber will find its status change
in two ticks.
